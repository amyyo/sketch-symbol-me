# Symbol me

This plug-in will convert the select layer to a symbol and updates all the other
layers with same name with symbol just created.

This is really helpful when you want to covert a bunch of scattered (nested deep down and its painful to select all of them one by one) layers to symbols.

# Usage

Select a layer that you want to convert to symbol and press `Command + Shift + U` this automatically finds all the layers with the same name and updates them with the newly created symbol.
